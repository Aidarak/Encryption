# Encryption
Individually worked on a program that allows a user to encode their text or decode their text given a specific cipher. The program only takes a cipher if it has 26 unique alphanumeric characters. If the user has inputted an invalid cipher, this program allows the user to try again until a valid cipher has been inputted.

This program accepts and validates user input by using a while loop to verify the length of the user cipher meets the requirement of having 26 unique alphanumeric characters. Data is processed according to user specifications by iterating through varied values using compound data types and manipulating compound data types.
